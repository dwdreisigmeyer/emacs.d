;;; Install:
;;  =======
;; You have first to install anything and traverselisp.
;; Then put this file somewhere in your load-path and:
;; (require 'anything-traverse)

;;; Usage:
;;  =====
;; `anything-traverse':
;;
;; M-x anything-traverse
;;
;; If you add `anything-c-source-traverse-occur' to `anything-sources'
;; you will be able to use traverse from the main anything, but the
;; variable `anything-traverse-check-only' will not be available:
;; When searching in a dired buffer the search will be performed on ALL files
;; unless you mark files in this buffer.
;; You can mark only one file and the search will be performed in this file only.
;; If instead you use `anything-traverse' , a prefix arg will be available:
;; C-u M-x anything-traverse will give you a prompt for the .ext/or regexp matching only files.
;; You can give as many .ext file you want at this prompt separated with a space.
;; You can add also regexp to this list or plain_word:
;; Exemple: SearchOnly:.el .sh$ TAGS .\.py~$
;; Will search only in .el .sh TAGS and .py~ files.
;; You can also use `anything-traverse' as `re-builder', when regexp in anything-pattern
;; satisfy you, you can copy it to kill-ring (select in actions).
;;
;; `anything-files-in-current-tree':
;;
;; M-x anything-files-in-current-tree
;; If you use  a prefix arg, the database will be updated.
;; If you have `anything-c-files-in-current-tree-allow-tagging' to a non--nil value
;; (the default) the anything tag file (`anything-c-files-in-current-tree-tag-file-name')
;; will be rewrited.
